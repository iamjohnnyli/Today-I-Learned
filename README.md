## Today I Learned

> Today I Learned - A list of all things I learn on daily basis.

This repository is inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and [adoyle-h/Today-I-Learned](https://github.com/adoyle-h/Today-I-Learned). It is a collection  of concise write-ups about discoveries I make in various technologies on a day-to-day basis. These write-ups aim to be informative, easily digestible, and cover a broad spectrum of topics accumulated over time.

You can read these TILs at [lijohnny.com/Today-I-Learned/](https://lijohnny.com/Today-I-Learned/) for a better reading experience, or search for specific topics.or use the search functionality to find specific topics.

## About  

This repository utilizes a minimal template for creating a site with the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme. To streamline the documentation process, I've developed Python scripts to automate various tasks, including the generating meta header for each Markdown file and the creating of `index.md` files in each folder to facilitate Jekyll's menu generation. If you are intrested, you can check [_doc_builder](/_doc_builder/) folder.
