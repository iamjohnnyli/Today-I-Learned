- Inpainting methods  
  
Limitations:  
  
- Imperfect replication of clothing details/poses  
- Inpainting requires adjusting poses individually  
  
Performance Issues:  
  
- Some clothing types better than others (suits vs swimwear)  
- No perfect off-the-shelf solution yet, especially for commercial use  
  
Suggested Approaches:  
  
- 3D modeling  
- E-commerce tools  
  
Overall Assessment: Generating realistic clothing images on human poses remains an open challenge without an ideal solution currently.
