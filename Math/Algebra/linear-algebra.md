## Linear Algebra
:label:`sec_linear-algebra`


Scalars:  
the expression $x \in \mathbb{R}$
is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar.
The symbol $\in$ (pronounced "in")
denotes membership in a set.
For example, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$
indicates that $x$ and $y$ are variables
that can only take values $0$ or $1$.

Vectors:
Caution: in Python, as in most programming languages, vector indices start at $0$, also known as *zero-based indexing*, whereas in linear algebra subscripts begin at $1$ (one-based indexing).
$$\mathbf{x} =\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}  \\ \vdots  \\x_{n}\end{bmatrix},$$

Matrices:  
Just as scalars are $0^{\textrm{th}}$-order tensors
and vectors are $1^{\textrm{st}}$-order tensors,
matrices are $2^{\textrm{nd}}$-order tensors.
